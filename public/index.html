					<button class="accordion">What is Hacklytics?</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p><br>Hacklytics is Georgia Tech’s 24 hour datathon brought to you by Data Science at Georgia Tech! Our theme for this year is "Change the World" with a focus on sustainability and growth. We hope to see fun, impactful and insightful projects that seek to bring change to society.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">What is a datathon?</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p><br>A datathon is a specific type of hackathon that focuses on data science. While this may make them seem constricted, we choose to approach them with the same idea as a normal hackathon, but applied to data science: whatever data you want, whatever language you want, whichever APIs you want, whatever ML/DL algorithm to analyze it you want.  You can create visualizations, make a model, come up with insights and anything you find impactful!</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">When and where is it?</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p><br>Hacklytics will be held from February 22nd-23rd 2020 in the Klaus Advanced Computing Building, (266 Ferst Dr NW, Atlanta, GA 30332).</p>

					<h3>GDP per capita (current US$)</h3>
					<p>Topic: General Economics
						<br>Website: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ny.gdp.pcap.cd
						<br>Description: Contains 9 different datasets that can be downloaded as CSV, Excel, or XML files. Most of the data sets are different measures of GDP per capita for a lot of countries (at least 200). It also contains a data set on inflation and another on oil rents.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>Harvard Opportunity Insights</h3>
					<p>Topic: Socioeconomic factors
						<br>Website: https://opportunityinsights.org/data/
						<br>Description: This site probably contains any information you might want about socioeconomic equality. There are around 50 datasets, A lot of them have to do with economic mobility and how it relates to race, gender, income, and other factors. In addition to economic mobility, datasets also cover geographical mobility and even the role colleges play in economic success. All datasets can be downloaded as Excel spreadsheets and there are READMEs associated with each one that talk about each field in the dataset.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>AHAR Reports</h3>
					<p>Topic: Homelessness
						<br>Website: https://www.hudexchange.info/homelessness-assistance/ahar/#2019-reports
						<br>Description: This site has around 30 datasets if you click around to find them. All these datasets are about homelessness. There are a few on here I think are really useful. The 2018 CoC Point in Time estimates contains homelessness counts for every county in the United States from 2007 to 2018. The 2019 section also contains data on veteran homelessness including change over the years. All datasets can be downloaded as Excel spreadsheets
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>Environmental Data Explorer</h3>
					<p>Topic: Environment
						<br>Website: http://geodata.grid.unep.ch/
						<br>Description: This is a database of environmental datasets. You can download all these datasets as either CSVs or Excel spreadsheets. The database is also searchable making it easy to hone in on certain topics you might be interested in. Unfortunately, it seems like the newest data on there is still a few years old, so it might not be the best dataset for looking at new trends, but for looking at long term trends from the past 50 years or so, this would be a good source.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>Federal Reserve Economic Data</h3>
					<p>Topic: General Economics
						<br>Website: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/
						<br>Description: 627,000 searchable datasets about information from unemployment to inflation to population statistics. You can not only download these datasets as csv files or excel files, but also download graphs created by the data as an image, PowerPoint, or PDF. This is probably one of the best sources you can get for American economic data.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>Humanitation Data Exchange</h3>
					<p>Topic: Socioeconomic factors
						<br>Website: https://data.humdata.org/
						<br>Description: This dataset focuses a lot of developing countries and the problems they face. You can find information like access to electricity, access to education. Datasets are usually available as CSV files and Excel files. Unfortunately, you need to request access for some of the listings in this database. A lot of the data also has accompanying reports in the form of PDFs and even some PowerBI’s that you can use to make more sense of the data.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>NORA Climate Datasets</h3>
					<p>Topic: Environment
						<br>Website: https://www.climate.gov/maps-data/datasets
						<br>Description: There are around 50 different datasets and datamaps on this site, all related to weather patterns and changes over time. Not all the data can be downloaded as CSVs or Excel spreadsheets as there are some maps. In addition, actually acquiring the dataset seems somewhat involved for a lot of the datasets listed. There are how-to tabs that describe the process of getting a particular dataset, but it’s a bit more than simply clicking a download link.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>Data.gov</h3>
					<p>Topic: Everything
						<br>Website: https://catalog.data.gov/dataset
						<br>Description: This is a searchable database from the US Government about everything. There are over 250,000 datasets in this database. Unfortunately, not all of them are downloadable as CSV or Excel files, but there are enough datasets to be useful here. You can search by tags as well. As a side note, I actually found this database while looking for pollution datasets, so this might be pretty good if you are looking for environment related data.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>Big Bad NLP Database</h3>
					<p>Topic: General NLP / Machine Learning
						<br>Website: https://quantumstat.com/dataset/dataset.html
						<br>Description: 200 datasets that all have descriptions on what they are about. If you want to do an NLP project, this might be a good place to start. Most datasets are available for download in either JSON, CSV formats.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>Lyft Level 5</h3>
					<p>Topic: Autonomous Vehicles
						<br>Website: https://level5.lyft.com/dataset/
						<br>Description: This is pretty different from the other datasets as it contains annotated images taken from Lyft L5’s self-driving car fleet. There are over 55,000 human-labeled 3d annotated frames, data from cameras and lidars, and drivable surface maps included.
						</p>
				</div>
				<div class="flexItem">
					<h3>Taskmaster-1 dataset</h3>
					<p>Topic: NLP / Human-understanding AIs
						<br>Website: https://storage.googleapis.com/dialog-data-corpus/TASKMASTER-1-2019/landing_page.html
						<br>Description: The dataset consists of 13,215 task-based dialogs, including 5,507 spoken and 7,708 written dialogs created with two distinct procedures. Each conversation falls into one of six domains: ordering pizza, creating auto repair appointments, setting up ride service, ordering movie tickets, ordering coffee drinks and making restaurant reservations. For more information, there is a readme on the website. You’ll need to download the dataset using command line tools.
